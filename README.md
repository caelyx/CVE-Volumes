* A CVSSv3 severity of `CRITICAL`; or
* If no CVSSv3 score is included, a CVSSv2 base score of 10.

1. Download the summary files for the years you're interested in from the NVD's [data feeds page](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds), saving them to the `data` directory.
2. Generate the CSV files with ```python3 generateStats.py```
3. Generate the yearly and monthly graphs with ```python3 generateYearlyGraph.py``` and ```python3 generateMonthlyGraph.py``` respectively. They will be saved as `.png` files in the working directory.
